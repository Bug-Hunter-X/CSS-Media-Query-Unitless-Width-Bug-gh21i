The solution is simple: always specify the unit for the `width` property, even within media queries.

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .element {
    width: 100%; /* Correct: uses percentage unit */
  }
}
```

By explicitly using `100%`, we ensure that the element's width is correctly set to 100% of its containing element's width within the specified media query breakpoint.
