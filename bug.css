The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue: using a unitless value for the `width` property within a media query.

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .element {
    width: 100;
  }
}
```

This might seem correct, aiming to set the width to 100% at smaller screen sizes. However, omitting the percentage sign ('%') or other units causes the `width` to be interpreted as 100 pixels.
